Fill the function adultsAverageAge(), which gets an array of users as parameter.

A user object in the received array will look like this:

{
  "id": 123,
  "name": "Alex Smith",
  "age": 20,
}

Calculate the average age of those users who are adults (above or equal 18). Return the result (as a number).
You do not have to deal with the case, when there are only underage users in the list.
